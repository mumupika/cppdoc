A program shall contain a global namespace function named `main`, which is the designated start of the program in hosted environment. It shall have one of the following forms:

<DeclDoc>
  <Fragment slot="decl">
    ```cpp
    int main() { /* body */ }
    ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="doc">
    A `main` function running independently of environment-provided arguments.
  </Fragment>
</DeclDoc>

<DeclDoc>
  <Fragment slot="decl">
    ```cpp
    int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { /* body */ }
    ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="doc">
    A `main` function accepting environment-provided arguments.

    The names of `argc` and `argv` are arbitrary, as well as the representation of the types of the parameters: `int main(int ac, char** av)` is equally valid.
  </Fragment>
</DeclDoc>

<DeclDoc>
  <Fragment slot="decl">
    ```cpp
    int main(/* implementation-defined */) { /* body */ }
    ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="doc">
    A main function of implement-defined type, returning `int`.
  </Fragment>
</DeclDoc>

The C++ standard recommends implementation-defined main functions to place the extra (optional) parameters after `argv`.

<ParamDocList>
  <ParamDoc name="argc">
    Non-negative value representing the number of arguments passed to the program from the environment in which the program is run.
  </ParamDoc>
  <ParamDoc name="argv">
    Pointer to the first element of an array of `argc + 1` pointers, of which the last one is null and the previous ones, if any, point to <Missing>null-terminated multibyte strings</Missing> that represent the arguments passed to the program from the execution environment. If `argv[0]` is not a null pointer (or, equivalently, if `argc > 0`), it points to a string that represents the name used to invoke the program, or to an empty string.
  </ParamDoc>
  <ParamDoc name="body">
    The body of the `main` function.
  </ParamDoc>
</ParamDocList>

## Explanation

The `main` function is called at program startup after <Missing>initialization</Missing> of the non-local objects with static storage duration. It is the designated entry point to a program that is executed in <Missing>hosted</Missing> environment (that is, with an operating system). The entry points to <Missing>freestanding</Missing> programs (boot loaders, OS kernels, etc) are implementation-defined.

The parameters of the two-parameter form of the `main` function allow arbitrary multibyte character strings to be passed from the execution environment (these are typically known as _command line arguments_), the pointers [`argv[1]`, `argv[argc - 1]`] point at the first characters in each of these strings. `argv[0]` (if non-null) is the pointer to the initial character of a null-terminated multibyte string that represents the name used to invoke the program itself (or an empty string `""` if this is not supported by the execution environment). The strings are modifiable, although these modifications do not propagate back to the execution environment: they can be used, for example, with <Missing>`std::strtok`</Missing>. The size of the array pointed to by `argv` is at least `argc + 1`, and the last element, `argv[argc]`, is guaranteed to be a null pointer.

The `main` function has the following several special properties:

- The body of the `main` function does not need to contain the <Missing>`return` statement</Missing>: if control reaches the end of main without encountering a `return` statement, the effect is that of executing `return 0;`.
- Execution of the return (or the implicit return upon reaching the end of main) is equivalent to first leaving the function normally (which destroys the objects with automatic storage duration <Revision since="C++26">and evaluates any <Missing>postcondition assertions</Missing> of main</Revision>) and then calling <Missing>`std::exit`</Missing> with the same argument as the argument of the return (<Missing>`std::exit`</Missing> then destroys static objects and terminates the program).



The `main` function has several restrictions (violation of which renders the program ill-formed):

- It cannot be <Missing>named</Missing> anywhere in the program
  - in particular, it cannot be called recursively
  - its address cannot be taken
  - it cannot be used in a <Missing>`typeid`</Missing> expression <Revision since="C++11">or a <Missing>`decltype`</Missing> specifier</Revision>
- It cannot be predefined and cannot be overloaded: effectively, the name `main` in the global namespace is reserved for functions (although it can be used to name classes, namespaces, enumerations, and any entity in a non-global namespace, except that an entity named `main` cannot be declared with C <Missing>language linkage</Missing> in any namespace).
- It cannot be defined <Revision since="C++11">as deleted or</Revision> declared with any language linkage, <Revision since="C++11"><Missing>constexpr</Missing></Revision>, <Revision since="C++20"><Missing>consteval</Missing></Revision>, <Missing>inline</Missing>, or <Missing>static</Missing>.
- <Revision since="C++14">The return type of the `main` function cannot be deduced (`auto main() {...}` is not allowed).</Revision>
- <Revision since="C++20">The `main` function cannot be a <Missing>coroutine</Missing>.</Revision>
- <Revision since="C++20">The `main` function cannot attach to a named <Missing>module</Missing>.</Revision>

## Notes

If the `main` function is defined with a <Missing>function `try` block</Missing>, the exceptions thrown by the destructors of static objects (which are destroyed by the implied <Missing>`std::exit`</Missing>) are not <Missing>caught</Missing> by it.

The manner in which the arguments given at the OS command line are converted into the multibyte character arrays referenced by `argv` may involve implementation-defined processing: 

- MSDN: [Parsing C++ Command-Line Arguments](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/main-function-command-line-args)
- POSIX: [Shell Introduction](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html#tag_18_01)

A very common implementation-defined form of `main()` has a third argument (in addition to `argc` and `argv`), of type `char**`, pointing at [an array of pointers to the execution environment variables](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/exec.html).

## Example

Demonstrates how to inform a program about where to find its input and where to write its results. A possible invocation: `./convert table_in.dat table_out.dat`

```cpp
#include <cstdlib>
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  std::cout << "argc == " << argc << '\n';

  for (int ndx{}; ndx != argc; ++ndx)
    std::cout << "argv[" << ndx << "] == " << std::quoted(argv[ndx]) << '\n';
  std::cout << "argv[" << argc << "] == "
            << static_cast<void*>(argv[argc]) << '\n';

  /* ... */

  return argc == 3 ? EXIT_SUCCESS : EXIT_FAILURE; // optional return value
}
```

Possible output:

```
argc == 3
argv[0] == "./convert"
argv[1] == "table_in.dat"
argv[2] == "table_out.dat"
argv[3] == 0
```
