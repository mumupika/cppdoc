**Thanks for your interest in contributing to CppDoc!**

CppDoc is an open documentation for the C/C++ programming languages and their standard libraries. It is built on top of the [Starlight] [Astro] theme, and maintained by C/C++ enthusiasts in an open community.

[Starlight]: https://starlight.astro.build/
[Astro]: https://astro.build/

<Aside type="tip">
  Currently CppDoc community members are working hard on migrating [cppreference](https://en.cppreference.com/index.html) pages to CppDoc. You're more than welcomed to join us if you want to help!
</Aside>

## Quick Start

### Clone the source

The source code of CppDoc is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/cppdoc-cc/cppdoc). You can clone the repository to your local by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cppdoc-cc/cppdoc.git
```

### Start the development server

When working locally, a development server allows you to preview your changes and automatically refreshes your browser when you make changes.

Inside the `cppdoc` project directory, run the following command to start the development server:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
    ```bash
    npm i
    npm run dev
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Add content and make changes

Documentation pages are typically written in MDX files. All these files are kept under the `src/content/docs` directory, which has a directory hierarchy as follows:

<FileTree>

- src/content/docs
  - c
    - language Documentation for the C programming language
      - …
    - library Documentation for the C standard library
      - …
  - cpp
    - language Documentation for the C++ programming language
      - …
    - library Documentation for the C++ standard library
      - …

</FileTree>

Read more about our documentation development guidelines in the [Development Guideline](./guide) section.

### Next steps

Once you have made a change, you can [issue a pull request](https://github.com/cppdoc-cc/cppdoc/compare) to submit your change to the CppDoc community. Community members will review your change, and deploy it to the live CppDoc site.

## Build Static Website

CppDoc is a static website. To build a static site from the source code, run the following commands in the project directory:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
    ```bash
    npm i
    npm run build
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
